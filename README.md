This is a simple aggregation of all of the "Awesome --Topic name--" github repos I've found till date and I feel are important to get started in the corresponding Topic.

The topics are relevant to Data lifecycle, Machine Learning, Deep learning research and some distributed computing.

Note: Not all of these links are actively maintained but some of them may serve as good starting points.
