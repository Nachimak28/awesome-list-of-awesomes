[![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)
[![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](http://makeapullrequest.com)

This is a simple aggregation of all of the "Awesome --Topic name--" github repos I've found till date and I feel are important to get started in the corresponding Topic.

The topics are relevant to Data lifecycle, Machine Learning, Deep learning research and some distributed computing.

Note: Not all of these links are actively maintained but some of them may serve as good starting points. 
There are multiple lists for certain topics which may or may not have common links, I have added them with a serial number under the topic in no particular order.
