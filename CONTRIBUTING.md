* Please to create an issue in case of broken link or typos. 
* Feel free to create a Pull Request in case you find some new interesting awesome list and wish to add it yourself or help out in completing the TODOs, 
* Before adding a new list, please verify if that same repo/link isn't already a part of the existing list.
* In case of multiple links for a single topic, if they are forks of each other, please raise a PR to fix that with the latest fork's link.
